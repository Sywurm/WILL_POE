>Hi there, you must be the new hiring manager that's running the place while I'm out eh?
>Good to know, I'm the previous hiring manager, and I'm going on a weeks vacation, so they've hired you in the meantime as an intern to basically do my job for the week, we figure you can't mess this place up too bad in a week.
>Well I suppose no point in beating around the bush, let me show you around here, so you can get started as soon as possible, and so I can have my lovely holiday in the Bahamas.
